# EECE571G Group 9 NFT Market

To group members:

Please install Hardhat, openzeppelin. We will build our project based on the package ERC721 in openzeppelin which is a standard nft interface.

For now we only have implemented the mint function which can add token to one address. We still have more functions and test cases to finish.
